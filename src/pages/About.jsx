<h1>We make finding the right car simple</h1>
<p>

          Our marketplace connects people who need a car with vendors who have

          one. Browse, compare, and book without the paperwork maze.

<h2>Our story</h2>
<p>

            We started with a simple frustration: renting or buying a car

            meant calling around, guessing at prices and waiting for replies.
</p>
<p>

            So we built one place where vendors list their cars and customers

            see what is available, what it costs, and whether it is new or

            used. Booking takes a few clicks.
